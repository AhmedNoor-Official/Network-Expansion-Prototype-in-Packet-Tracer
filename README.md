# Network-Expansion-Prototype-in-Packet-Tracer

Network expansion.
Assignment task Description: 

Scenario
Recently there has been a change in the landscape of the local Halifax branch in Hatfield by adding a new floor to the main building. 
The computer network of the branch needs to be expanded too. The network designer has come with the topology in Figure 1: 

Figure 1:

As a new network engineer for this branch, I have been asked to assign IP addresses and configure this small network for full connectivity.



Task 1:
I needed to configure the network according to Figure 1. The IP address is given to the network is 192.168.X.0 /24 where X will be the last two digits of your student ID.
To make sure that everything is tested properly before the implementation, an initial prototype will be built on Packet Tracer. 
You need to configure all the LAN and WAN interfaces on routers and PCs according to the IP subnetted addresses.
When all PCs can ping their default gateways and each other from the old network to the new expansion, then the configuration is implemented correctly.

Requirements:
I completed the followings

1.	Implemented the physical topology using Packet Tracer
2.	Assigned correct IPv4 address to the network using subnetting.
3.	Created a table for all the IP address allocated:
Device, 	Interface, 	IP Address or Network, and 	Default Gateway 
			
			
4.	Configured all the devices  
5.	The IP address for the calculation of the subnets was 192.168.X.0 /24 where X was the last two digits of my ID.

6.	Provided the screenshots of the Ping results from:
a.	1-Admin computer to the Server
b.	2-Management computer to accountant
c.	3-Ping result from Wireless laptop to ISP
d.	4-Ping result from Admin to ISP

Task 2:
I provided a report of 1000 words where i explained the role of the Default Gateway and i evaluated the use and benefits of Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for Task 1. 

I also added the DHCP configuration commands and implemented it in my configuration.
